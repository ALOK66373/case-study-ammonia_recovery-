Advanced ammonia recovery
 This ammonia recovery project is dedicated to understand the mass transfer laws:

Here we are dealing with 3 equations that are : Absorption : Kg(C-H)        Stripping : Kl(C-H)      Membrane Separation :  Pa*C/L

Kg is gas diffusivity coefficient 
Kl is liquid diffusivity coefficient
H is henry law constant that is dependent on equillibrium of gas and liquid phases
Pa permeability for phase separation
C concentration 
L thickness of the gas liquid layed

Here firstly gas containg Ammonia get absorbed by the liquid (generally water or acid) then membrane separation occur in which ammonia from the mixture is separated only gas
phase can move out of the semi permeable membrane.And the rest of ammonia that is left of eith liquid can be separated out by stripping.

here pH plays a very important role like high ph always favours mass transfer.It is derived from henderson hassalbach equation and fraction of ammonia to the whole mixture directly proportional
to pH. pKa here we take ~9.6 that is constant at 25 degree celcius. 

Then we prepare a Random forest ml model to predict the concentration of Ammonia. 

Further i made a GUI with the help of pyQt5  from here future scopes and optimization start.


 **Process Optimization (Recovery + Cost + Energy**
   
1.Area	Optimization Goals
-Parameter tuning	Use genetic algorithms, grid search, or PSO to find optimal k_G, k_L, P_A, and pH for max NH‚ÇÉ recovery or minimum energy
-Stage sequencing	Should absorption always be first? Try different orders or combinations (e.g., membrane before stripping)
-Energy minimization	Model energy cost (kWh) per kg NH‚ÇÉ recovered and optimize to reduce operating cost
-Multi-objective optimization	Balance between recovery %, energy use, and process time

üß™ 2. Real Chemistry Integration
Enhancement	Impact
NH‚ÇÉ/NH‚ÇÑ‚Å∫ + CO‚ÇÇ equilibrium	More accurate for wastewater and atmospheric systems
Temperature effect	Add temperature-sensitive Henry‚Äôs constant & pKa
Ion interference	Add salinity, ionic strength, buffering effects

ü§ñ 3. Machine Learning Expansion
ML Use Case	Benefit
Surrogate modeling	Train ML to predict recovery given process parameters ‚Äî way faster than full physical simulation
Auto-tuning with RL	Reinforcement learning to auto-control pH, flow, etc. for best efficiency
Anomaly detection	Monitor real-time data to spot sensor faults or process drift in deployed plants

üåê 4. Cloud-Based GUI / Web Deployment
‚úÖ Convert the PyQt GUI to:
Web app using Flask + React or Streamlit for browser use
Cloud dashboard for remote process monitoring
üì° Allow real-time data feed from sensors or simulation runs

‚ôª 5. Global Deployment Scenarios
Scenario	Relevance
-Agricultural runoff	Optimize NH‚ÇÉ capture from fertilizers (low-conc sources)
-Wastewater treatment plants	Dynamic optimization for pH and temperature fluctuations
-Closed-loop nutrient recovery	Recycle NH‚ÇÉ as fertilizer in circular economy systems
-Decentralized units	Compact systems for rural or mobile use, controlled via app/GUI

üß≠ Strategic Goals
üí° From R&D to Real-World Use:
Build a recommendation engine: Given target recovery or energy budget, suggest best settings
Pilot studies: Simulate 24h industrial datasets
Partnerships with environmental labs or utilities

üõ† Tools You Can Add for Optimization:
Tool	Use
scipy.optimize	Local/global parameter optimization
pymoo / platypus	Multi-objective optimization (Pareto front)
DEAP	Evolutionary algorithms (genetic optimization)
Optuna	Powerful hyperparameter and system optimization framework

‚úÖ Summary :- 

We've built a strong foundation ‚Äî a working model, a functional GUI, and real mass transfer theory.
Now we're ready to:
Scale it for global relevance üåé
Optimize for real-world constraints ‚öô
